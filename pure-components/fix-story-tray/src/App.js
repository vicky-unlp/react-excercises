// The CEO of your company is asking you to add “stories” to your online

// that accepts a list of stories, followed by a “Create Story” placeholder.

// You implemented the “Create Story” placeholder by pushing one more fake 
// story at the end of the stories array that you receive as a prop. But for 
// some reason, “Create Story” appears more than once. Fix the issue.
